# IS362_PROJECT3

In this project (requirement document attached), you'll read information from a SQL database into a pandas DataFrame.

The amount of Python code required should be small.  There is however a lot of potentially time consuming work, since you'll need to:

-Install the Chinook database for your RDBMS.
-Write a SQL query that joins information across five tables.
-Research, install, and reference any middleware library required for your RDBMS
-Determine the correct connection string for your RDBMS
